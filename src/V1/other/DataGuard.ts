/**
 * A DataGuard inspects a piece of data to see if the data meets a
 * given contract / specification.
 *
 * If the given data does meet the contract, the function returns `true`.
 * It returns `false` otherwise.
 *
 * DataGuards work best when they check for one thing, for something that
 * can't meaningfully be broken down into multiple things.
 *
 * That makes them very reusable, and it allows you to build up rich
 * error reporting in your code.
 *
 * `T` is the type of data to be inspected.
