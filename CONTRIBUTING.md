## Getting Started

### Fixing Bugs

Is there an open [issue][issues] for the bug? Please check first.

* If there isn't, please open an issue. We need somewhere for us all to discuss the bug and agree on what the fix should be.
* If there is, please don't open a new issue. Use the existing issue to discuss the fix you want to merge in.

Please make sure your pull request mentions which issue(s) it fixes.

### Submitting A New Feature

Please check our [issues][issues] list first. Is there an existing issue that covers your new feature? If not, please open a new issue, so that we've got somewhere to discuss the feature.

## Pull Requests

We need a new pull request for every bugfix or feature that you wish to contribute.

Follow these steps for your features or fixes:

1. if you don't have one already, create an account on Github
2. on Github, fork our project
3. clone your fork to your local computer
4. create a new branch on your local computer: `git checkout -b feature/<my-feature> develop`
5. work on your feature
6. commit it, and push it back up to your fork

When you're ready to submit your pull request, please make sure it's a pull request against our `develop` branch.

## How We'll Check Your Pull Request

We'll check your pull request for the following:

1. does the pull request address a single open GitHub issue?
2. does the pull request apply cleanly against our `develop` branch?
3. does it fit within the existing scope of the library?
4. does it fit our goals for the library?
5. does it fit our coding style?
6. does it come will 100% unit test coverage?
7. does the pull request include updated docs showing how the new feature works?

If the answer is 'no' to any of those, we'll respond and let you know what we need you to do before we can accept your pull request.

## Accepted Contributions

If we accept your pull request, we'll add your details to our [authors](AUTHORS.md) page, so that your contribution is acknowledged. We'll also add details of your change to our [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) page.
